# To-Do Website

This To-Do website project was created as a part of my journey in learning JavaScript. It serves as a practical application to understand event handling and utilizing local storage in web development.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Complete Tasks**: Mark tasks as complete once you finish them.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that you no longer need.
- **Persistent Storage**: Utilizes local storage to save your to-do list, ensuring your tasks are saved even when you close or refresh the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and content of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styles the webpage for a better user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the functionality of the to-do list, including event handling and local storage management.
